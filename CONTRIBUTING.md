# Contributing to bs4dash-py

Thanks for considering contributing! Please follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch (e.g., `feature/my-component`).
- Run the test suite locally: `pip install -e '.[dev]'` then `pytest -q`.
- Run pre-commit hooks and formatting: `pre-commit install` then `pre-commit run --all-files`.
- Keep changes focused and open a PR against `main` with a clear description and changelog entry.

For large features, open an issue first to discuss design.
